#### **MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS:**  
_Visual C++ Redistributable 2015-2022 (Installer in Requirements folder)  
CPU: AMD Athlon 64 X2 4000+

RAM: 3 GB DDR2 600 MHz

This has been built and tested mostly on Windows 10 so I can't guarantee that it will work on older versions or Windows 11. I did run it on Windows 7 and it worked fine but not on Windows 8/8.1 or XP so don't expect support for that._

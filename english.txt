Saving them from terrible monsters and gathering rare medicinal herbs.
Until one fateful day that changed everything for the next couple years.
The thing that changed your life? An arrow... A simple arrow.
It destroyed your knee.

Unfortunately, after two years your skills are almost gone.
You have to regain your strength and your muscles before anything bad happens.
Get to level 25 by defeating enemies.
You can buy items/armors/weapons at the shop that will help in your battles.
Every time you defeat an enemy, you'll gain some xp and drops you can sell.
